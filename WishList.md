# Immediate Plans #

These are the things I am hoping to work on shortly

  1. For inner class add "InnerClassName.this" to member variables of the outer class
  1. Provide configuration screen to control behavior (i.e. some people might not like the "InnerClassName.this" construct)

# Possibilities #

  1. Provide an option to remove any evil prepending of underscore or "m`_`" to member variables and replace them with "this."
