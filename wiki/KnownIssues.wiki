= Known Issues =

The plugin is a work in progress and it currently has the following issues (I am actively looking into these issues):

  # Doesn't work inside an enum (not sure why)
  # A class that references a member variable in another instance of the same class gets "this." appened to it. This shows up in "equals()" most often. I actually think this is an a bug in IntelliJ that is returning that usage as a reference. I am checking into this. To illustrate, consider the following class:

{{{
public class Person {
    private String name;

    public Person() {
        this.name = "Smitty Johnson";
    }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

        Person person = (Person) o;
        return name.equals(person.name);

    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return name.hashCode();
    }
}

}}}

After the this inserter plugin is ran the return of the equals method looks like this:

{{{
return this.name.equals(person.this.name);
}}}

The "person.this.name" construct is incorrect, it should remain "person.name".
