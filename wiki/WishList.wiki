#summary Future changes planned for the plugin

= Immediate Plans =

These are the things I am hoping to work on shortly

  # In addition to member variables also add "this." to method calls in the same class
  # For inner class add "InnerClassName.this" to member variables of the outer class
  # Provide configuration screen to control behavior (i.e. some people might not like the "InnerClassName.this" construct)

= Possibilities =

  # Provide an option to remove any evil prepending of underscore or "m_" to member variables and replace them with "this."
